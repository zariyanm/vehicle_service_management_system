# vehicle_service_management_system

## Project Overview
This is a **Vehicle Service Management System** that helps track vehicle service history and maintenance schedules.  
The system allows users to **add, view, search, update, and delete service records**.  
It is built with a modern architecture:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS, inspired by docs.chaicode.com)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database:** MySQL (with stored procedures)  

The application updates the interface dynamically using JavaScript (no page reload) and validates user input before sending it to the backend.
